## 👋 Hi there! I’m Kaustav Chakrabarti

I’m an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist currently pursuing my B.Eng. in Information Engineering and Media (Honours with Distinction) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I’m passionate about building impactful AI-driven products and research-backed solutions that blend innovation with real-world application.

---

### 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On
- Fine-tuning and evaluating **lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs)** for reasoning and domain-specific tasks at Desay SV.
- Exploring **semantic similarity metrics** like SBERT, BLEU, ROUGE for efficient model evaluation.
- Applying **graph-based deep learning** (GCNs) for **text classification and contextual understanding** in academic research.
- Developing a **glaucoma detection system** using **RETFound**, combining OCT and fundus image analysis with LLM-powered clinical report generation.

---

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- **ML Ops** workflows for model deployment and scalability.
- Advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **multimodal learning techniques**.
- Real-time **fraud detection, sentiment analysis**, and **bias detection** using transformers like RoBERTa and LLaMA.
- AI evaluation strategies and ethical applications of generative AI in healthcare and cybersecurity.

---

### 👯 Open to Collaborations
I’m actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on:
- Open-source LLM/NLP tools and research projects.
- AI in healthcare – especially medical image interpretation and automated diagnostics.
- Developer tools that use **AI to optimize workflows** (e.g., PR review automation, documentation bots).
- Real-world applications of **anomaly detection**, **time series forecasting**, and **AI-powered browser extensions**.

---

### 🤔 Areas Where I’d Love Help
- Contributing to open-source projects involving **transformer architectures**, **vector search**, and **retrieval-augmented generation** (RAG).
- Efficient deployment of LLMs using frameworks like **Ollama**, **Unsloth**, and **LangChain**.
- Research mentorship and guidance on publishing in AI/ML conferences.

---

### 💬 Let’s Talk About
- Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision
- Hackathons and project ideation 💡
- Scaling AI from prototype to production
- Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, and full-stack AI engineering

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I love turning hackathon ideas into fully functional products — with APIs, dashboards, and end-to-end automation — even before the weekend ends! ⚙️  
When I’m not coding, I’m probably building calisthenics routines or tweaking productivity systems.
